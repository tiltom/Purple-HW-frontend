# Purple-HW-frontend
This repository contains backend for currency converter (Purple interview assignment).

## Notes to the solution
* The app expects backend on `localhost:5001`. If you decide to run backend on some other port or host it in cloud, just change `backendApiBaseUrl` in `ConvertSection.tsx`.
This is the only place you need to adjust.
